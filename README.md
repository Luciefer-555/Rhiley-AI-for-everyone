Rhiley AI
Your AI that sees, thinks, and builds.

A self-hosted AI frontend engineer that writes production-grade React code, rewires its own brain, and learns from 8,000+ real design examples — all running privately on your machine.

What is Rhiley?

Rhiley is a fully local AI frontend engineer built on top of LLMs via Ollama.

It is not a wrapper around ChatGPT.
It runs 100% on your machine, learns from your codebase, and improves over time.

You talk to it like a developer.
It builds like one.

Example:

"build a glassmorphism dashboard with animated recharts"

Rhiley responds with:

Complete React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion code

Live preview inside the chat

Real production patterns from 8,017 scraped examples

Core Features
🧠 Self-Rewiring Brain

Rhiley can learn new skills in real time.

Example:

"rewire yourself to be world class at GSAP scroll animations"

It will:
